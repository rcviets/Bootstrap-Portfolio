            <p>I was born in Tehachapi, California and lived there for seventeen years. Afterwards, I moved to
              Madison Wisconsin. I went to school for Mechanical Engineering, but unfortunately my finances ran out
              and
              I left
              in my Junior year. I moved to Utah in 2015 and got a job working in the film industry as a Director's
              Assistant
              for Taylor Sheridan. Together we worked on the film WIND RIVER that went on to win multiple awards, and
              is
              currently available on Netflix.</p>
            <p>Later, I got a job at a merchandising company and traveled around the US and Canada attending Comic
              Book,
              Video
              Game, and Anime conventions as a salesman. I received a promotion after my first year, and was the head
              of
              the
              entire department. I enjoyed this job very much; I traveled constantly, saw many cities I'd never
              visited
              before,
              got to sample the best foods every place had to offer, and expanded my cultural knowledge. Though, at
              the
              same
              time I was gone almost every holiday, and most of the summer. It was exhausting and extremely stressful.
              I
              also
              realized that I had reached my peak within the company; if I wanted to continue to grow as a person and
              in
              my
              career, I needed to complete some sort of skill-building education.</p>

            <p>Thus, I found my way to the University of Utah Coding Bootcamp. I knew that coding would be a good fit
              for me,
              because my greatest strengths have always been attention to detail and organization. I also really enjoy
              logic
              games, puzzles, and problem-solving. I came into the program with no experience in coding, other than
              HTML
              on
              Myspace ten years ago.</p>
